Excellent location! Next to Citic Square and opposite to Plaza66. The Line 2 metro station is within a 3-min stroll.
The room is slightly smaller than expected. I've stayed at the Regalia's serviced apartment in Suzhou once for a lower price and much bigger room. There's even no kitcenware in the mini-kitchen. Reckon it'll be kinda inconvenient for long-term guests. Anyway it's not a big deal to me as I don't bother cooking.
Choices at breakfast are limited. Service is pretty good though.
